# I.A.-Project-Visual-Cryptography-With-Genetic-Algorithms


At present, the security of digital images has generated interest due to the constant and growing use of images on a daily basis, the number of sensitive images in databases of all types of companies is increasing, databases that can be violated losing the information and privacy of the users, in this work we will present a cryptosystem that with the help of genetic algorithms and the logistic equation of chaos are capable of encrypting images, it is also analyzed and compared with some other visual cryptosystems, where the best encrypted image It will be the one with the lowest correlation coefficient and the highest entropy, in the same way we will compare the time it can take to encrypt an image with each method.
